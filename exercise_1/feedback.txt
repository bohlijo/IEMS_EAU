Exercise 2:

Some Python tips:
	Python's boolean datatype uses the identifiers True and False.
	So
		return "false"
	should be
		return False

	Doctest will automatically convert the returned value of the test into
	a testable string:
	>>> validateListIsIncreasing([])
	False

	You might even combine multiple expressions via the "and" or "or" logical
	expression:
	if not type(lst) == list or len(lst) == 0:
		return False

	You can create a list by using the bracked notation:
	sortedList = []

	If you want to create a dictionary you can use curved brackets:
	dict = {}
