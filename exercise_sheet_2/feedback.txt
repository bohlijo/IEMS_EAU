Exercise 1:
	Correct. Use IH (induction hypothesis) or IA (induction assumption),
	IB (induction base) and IS (induction step) as markers for each step.

Exercise 2:
	Small flaw in your last two terms, but ok.

Exercise 3:
	Correct.

Some Python tips:
	If you construct a range with a step size of 1 you can omit this parameter:
	range(0, len(heap) - 1)
	If the range starts at 0 you can omit the start parameter too:
	range(len(heap) - 1)

	You can access the last element of a list with the index of -1.
	So you can use heap[-1] instead of heap[len(heap) - 1].

	The pop operation removes the last item of the list.
	So heap.pop(len(heap) - 1) can be simplified to heap.pop().

Don't hesitate to ask if you need help or something is unclear.
